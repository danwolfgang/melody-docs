# Extending Your Web Site

By now, you should be familiar with the very basics of Melody's templating, theme and design system. Plus, if you have been following along then you also have in place a very simple web site you have built using Melody. Although to say this web site is "simple" is an understatement because in truth all you have done is published a single page: the homepage. 

To some this may actually be more than sufficient, but in all likelihood this barely scratches the surface of what you have envisioned for your web site. 

In this section, we will begin to slow expand upon what you have already created through a series of simple to follow recipes.
